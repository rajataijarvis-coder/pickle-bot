# Pickle-Bot

Your own AI assistant. Name it. Talk to it. Teach it things. Important fact [Pickle](https://www.instagram.com/pickle__chen/) is a standard little cat.

Pickle-bot is a yet another lightweight version of [Openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).

The project started with the mindset of building-you-own-openclaw, but end up staying on my raspberry PI, dealing with all daily manners.

## Fun Facts

### Why Naming Agents with These Names?

Pickle is my cat, as mentioned at the beginning. She is really talktive, definitely more than you can think about.

Cookie was her Step brother, but he lives somewhere else now. so he manage memories on behalf of Pickle.

### She's your Cat, Why Matters to Me?

Create your own agents by dropping a file in `agents/{name}/AGENT.md`. Give them a name, a personality. Give them skills.
